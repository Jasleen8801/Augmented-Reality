# Extended Reality

It is the extension of the current reality, which further contains three other domains - AR, VR, MR

## Augmented Reality

It is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditary, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory.

### Types of Augmented Reality
 
- Marker-Based Augmented Reality
- Marker-Less Augmented Reality
- - Super Imposition AR
- - Location Based AR
- - Projection Based AR
- - Outlining Based AR

#### Marker Based AR

It works on the concept of tracking and recognition and augments Digital objects upon a marker.
Example: Pokemon Go

#### Markerkess AR

This type of AR can simply detect your plane and perform the augmentation of your digital objects.
Example: Ikea Place

## Virtual Reality

It is the computer-generated simulation of a #-D image or environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by a person using special electronic equipment such as a helmet with a screen inside or gloves fitted with sensors.

## Mixed Reality

It is advanced form of AR where we make use Head Mounted Display (HMD's) to display the content on top of real-world sort of blend into the real world.
